These constraints will be read post-synthesis (as long as their source constraint file is marked as used_in_implementation) and should be applied correctly then. You should review the constraints listed in the file [.Xil/TESTBENCH_propImpl.xdc] and check the run log file to verify that these constraints were correctly applied.

These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/TESTBENCH_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/TESTBENCH_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.
